# Pokedex

Pokedex is a web application that allows users to learn more about Pokémon.
The application consumes data from the PokéAPI: https://pokeapi.co/ and renders the results on screen.
Pokedex is built with React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. It uses a caching mechanism to reduce the number of calls to the PokéAPI.
This means that users can quickly and easily access information about Pokémon. The application also includes a detailed information page for each Pokémon, which includes information such as the Pokémon's stats, types and more.

## Setup & Run
